# specifically-Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphisms-Classification

This project investigates the potential to classify individuals into populations based on their genetic information, specifically Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The analysis involved using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to visualize and quantify genetic differentiation across French, Spanish, and Turkish populations.
